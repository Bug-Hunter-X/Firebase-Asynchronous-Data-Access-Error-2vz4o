The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a document or collection before the promise returned by `getDocs()` or `getDoc()` has resolved.  This often leads to errors like `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...' )` or similar, where the property you are trying to access from the returned document or collection is undefined because the data hasn't loaded yet.
